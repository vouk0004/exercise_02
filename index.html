<h1>Hey, remember this stuff from when we were kids?</h1>

<hr>

<h2>My favorite flash game that I would play in the computer lab</h2>
<p>Ok so there are a lot of different games that I could list here. <br>Run, Spank the Monkey, Bowman, Bloons Tower
    Defense 4 (and then BTD5 once we were in middle school)--I could go on for hours. But the classic game that I keep
    going back to is Fancy Pants Man, specifically Fancy Pants Adventure 2. A good balance of simple, yet creative
    mechanics in a really fun-looking world. If you don't remember Fancy Pants Man, you should play it...like right now
    (obviously on Addicting Games).</p>

<h2>My favorite Disney Channel original movie</h2>
<p>Again, there are a lot I could list here. The Cheetah Girls, The Thirteenth Year, Smart House, High School Musical
    (overrated, but still good), and Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior are just a few memorable ones (though Smart House was
    memorable for the wrong reasons). But the Disney Channel Origanal Movie that stands out to me the most is
    Halloweentown (1-3). These movies are admittedly pretty strange, but as a kid they got me f*cking PUMPED for
    Halloween. Like, if I didn't watch at least one Halloweentown movie at some point in October, then I'd probably
    refuse to go Trick-or-Treating. In Return to Halloweentown, they recast Marnie for some reason and honestly, the new
    actress just didn't have the same charm as the original. If you've never seen the Halloweentown movies, here's a
    clip from the first one:</p>

        corner)

    <li>A pencil sharpener shaped like Lightning McQueen</li>
</ul>
